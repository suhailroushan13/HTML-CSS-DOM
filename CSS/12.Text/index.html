<!-- The properties that allow you to control
the appearance of text can be split into
two groups:
● Those that directly affect the font and its appearance
(including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic,
and the size of the text)
● Those that would have the same effect on text no matter
what font you were using (including the color of text and
the spacing between words and letters)
The formatting of your text can have a significant effect
on how readable your pages are. As we look through these
properties I will also give you some design tips on how to
display your type. -->

<!-- In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), text can be styled using various properties to change its appearance. Here are some commonly used properties for styling text in CSS:

font-family: This property specifies the font family of the text.

font-size: This property specifies the size of the font.

font-weight: This property specifies the boldness of the font.

color: This property specifies the color of the text.

text-align: This property specifies the alignment of the text.

text-decoration: This property specifies the decoration of the text (e.g., underline, strikethrough).

text-transform: This property specifies how the text should be transformed (e.g., uppercase, lowercase).

line-height: This property specifies the height of each line of text.

letter-spacing: This property specifies the spacing between each letter of text.

word-spacing: This property specifies the spacing between each word of text.

These are just a few examples of the many properties available for styling text in CSS. By combining these properties with other CSS rules, you can create a wide variety of text styles and layouts. -->

<!-- There are properties to control the choice of font, size,
weight, style, and spacing.
X There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume
most people will have installed.
X If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are
several options, but you need to have the right license
to use them.
X You can control the space between lines of text,
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be
indented.
X You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an
element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or
when they have visited a link -->
