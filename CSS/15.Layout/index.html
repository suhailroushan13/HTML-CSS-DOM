<!-- In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), there are several techniques for creating layouts, including:

Floats: Floats are used to position elements to the left or right of their container. They are commonly used to create multi-column layouts, such as for a navigation menu or a sidebar.

Flexbox: Flexbox is a layout mode that enables flexible and responsive layouts. It allows you to align and distribute elements along a single axis (either horizontally or vertically) and can be used to create complex layouts with minimal code.

Grid: Grid is a layout mode that allows you to create two-dimensional layouts with rows and columns. It enables you to define the size and position of each element on the grid, making it a powerful tool for creating complex and responsive layouts.

Positioning: Positioning enables you to position elements precisely within their container or relative to other elements. You can use the position property with values such as absolute, relative, or fixed to position elements as needed.

Responsive design: Responsive design is a technique for creating layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This is typically achieved using media queries, which allow you to apply different styles based on the screen size or device type.

These are just a few examples of the many techniques available for creating layouts in CSS. By combining these techniques with other CSS rules and properties, you can create a wide variety of layouts that are visually appealing, user-friendly, and responsive to different devices and screen sizes. -->
