<!-- HTML5 introduced new semantic elements that make it easier to create structured, well-designed web pages. These semantic elements provide a standardized way to define the main sections of a web page, making it easier for search engines and other tools to understand the page's content. Here are some of the commonly used semantic elements for creating a layout in HTML5:

header: This element represents the introductory content of a page, typically containing a logo, navigation menu, and other elements that are repeated across multiple pages.

nav: This element represents a section of the page that contains navigation links, such as a menu or a list of links to related pages.

main: This element represents the main content of the page, such as the article, blog post, or product listing.

aside: This element represents a section of the page that contains secondary content, such as a sidebar or a call-to-action box.

section: This element represents a section of the page that groups related content together, such as a section containing a list of products or a set of frequently asked questions.

article: This element represents a self-contained piece of content that can be reused or distributed independently, such as a blog post or news article.

footer: This element represents the footer of a page, typically containing copyright information, contact details, and other elements that are repeated across multiple pages.

By using these semantic elements, you can create a structured and well-designed layout for your web pages that is easy to read, navigate, and understand. -->
