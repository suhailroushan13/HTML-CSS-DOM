<!-- CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of
an element should appear. For example, you can specify that
the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should
appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one
headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.
Once you have learned how to write a CSS rule, learning CSS
mostly involves learning the different properties you can use.
So this chapter will:
● Introduce you to how CSS works
● Teach you how to write CSS rules
● Show you how CSS rules apply to HTML pages
The remaining chapters in this section will look at all of the
various CSS properties you can use -->

<!-- CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two
parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

<!-- X CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.
X Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).
X Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.
X Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
X CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page. -->
