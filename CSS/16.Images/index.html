<!-- In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), there are several properties and techniques for styling images. Here are some commonly used properties for styling images in CSS:

width: This property specifies the width of the image.

height: This property specifies the height of the image.

object-fit: This property specifies how the image should be resized to fit its container. Values can include contain, cover, fill, and more.

object-position: This property specifies the position of the image within its container.

background-image: This property specifies an image to use as the background for an element.

background-size: This property specifies the size of the background image.

background-repeat: This property specifies how the background image should be repeated.

background-position: This property specifies the position of the background image within its container.

filter: This property applies visual effects to an image, such as blur or brightness.

These are just a few examples of the many properties available for styling images in CSS. By combining these properties with other CSS rules and techniques, you can create visually appealing and dynamic image effects on your web pages. -->
