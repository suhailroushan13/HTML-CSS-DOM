<!-- In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), boxes are an essential component used to define the layout and structure of a web page. Here are some commonly used properties for styling boxes in CSS:

width: This property specifies the width of the box.

height: This property specifies the height of the box.

border: This property specifies the border of the box, including its style, width, and color.

padding: This property specifies the space between the content of the box and its border.

margin: This property specifies the space between the box and its neighboring elements.

background-color: This property specifies the background color of the box.

box-shadow: This property adds a shadow effect to the box.

border-radius: This property specifies the rounded corners of the box.

overflow: This property specifies what should happen if the content of the box is too large to fit inside its dimensions.

display: This property specifies how the box should be displayed, such as inline or block.

These are just a few examples of the many properties available for styling boxes in CSS. By combining these properties with other CSS rules, you can create a wide variety of box styles and layouts to make your web page visually appealing and well-structured.
