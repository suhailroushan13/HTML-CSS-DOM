HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides a way to create structured documents
 by defining elements and their attributes. Forms are an important element in HTML that allows users to interact with a webpage by entering data and submitting it to the server. Here's an example of a simple form in HTML:


<form action="/submit-form" method="POST">
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>

  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>

  <label for="message">Message:</label>
  <textarea id="message" name="message" required></textarea>

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
In this example, we have a form that contains three input fields:
 a text input for the name, an email input for the email address, 
 and a textarea input for the message. The label element is used to
  associate the input with its label, which provides context for the user.

The required attribute on each input ensures that the user must fill
 out that field before submitting the form. The action attribute 
 specifies where the form data should be submitted to, and the 
 method attribute specifies the HTTP method to use for the 
 request (usually POST for submitting form data).

Finally, the button element is used to create a button that the 
user can click to submit the form.

There are many other types of form elements and attributes available
 in HTML, including radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdown lists, and more.
