Headings

<h1>
<h2>
<h3>
<h4>
<h5>
<h6>
HTML has six "levels" of
headings:
<h1> is used for main headings
<h2> is used for subheadings
If there are further sections
under the subheadings then the
<h3> element is used, and so
on...
Browsers display the contents of
headings at different sizes. The
contents of an <h1> element is
the largest, and the contents of
an <h6> element is the smallest.
The exact size at which each
browser shows the headings
can vary slightly. Users can also
adjust the size of text in their
browser. You will see how to
control the size of text, its color,
and the fonts used when we
come to look at CSS

To create a paragraph, surround
the words that make up the
paragraph with an opening <p>
tag and closing </p> tag.
By default, a browser will show
each paragraph on a new line
with some space between it and
any subsequent paragraphs.
