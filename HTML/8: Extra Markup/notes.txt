Here is an example HTML code that demonstrates how to use escape 
characters to display special characters:

php
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Escape Characters Example</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Escape Characters Example</h1>
	<p>Here are some common escape characters in HTML:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>&lt; - less-than sign</li>
		<li>&gt; - greater-than sign</li>
		<li>&amp; - ampersand</li>
		<li>&quot; - double quote</li>
		<li>&apos; - single quote</li>
		<li>&nbsp; - non-breaking space</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you want to include one of these characters in your HTML,
     you can use the corresponding escape sequence instead. For example:</p>
	<p>This is a &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; text.</p>
	<p>This is an &ldquo;example&rdquo; sentence.</p>
	<p>This is a &ldquo;quote&rdquo; mark.</p>
	<p>This is a &amp;euro; symbol.</p>
</body>
</html>
In this example, we have used an unordered list to display some
 common escape characters in HTML. We have also shown how to use 
 escape characters to include special characters in HTML, 
 such as a less-than symbol, a double quote, or a euro symbol. 
 When the code is executed, the special characters will be 
 displayed correctly in the web browser.
