HTML Uses Elements
to Describe the
Structure of Pages
<html>
 <body>
 <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
 <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of
 the page. And if the page is a long one it might
 be split up into several sub-headings.<p>
 <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
 <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help
 you follow the structure of what is being written.
 There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level
 headings).</p>
 <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
 <p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>
 </body>
</html>

Tags act like containers. They tell you
something about the information that lies
between their opening and closing tags.
Description
The opening <html> tag indicates that anything between it and a closing </html> tag is HTML code.
The <body> tag indicates that anything between it and the closing
</body> tag should be shown inside the main browser window.
Words between <h1> and </h1> are a main heading.
A paragraph of text appears between these <p> and </p> tags.
Words between <h2> and </h2> form a sub-heading.
Here is another paragraph between opening <p> and closing </p> tags.
Another sub-heading inside <h2> and </h2> tags.
Another paragraph inside <p> and </p> tags.
The closing </body> tag indicates the end of what should appear in the main browser window.
The closing </html> tag indicates that it is the end of the HTML code.

The characters in the brackets
indicate the tag's purpose.
For example, in the tags above
the p stands for paragraph.
The closing tag has a forward
slash after the the < symbol >

</p>
left-angle bracket
The terms "tag" and "element"
are often used interchangeably.
Strictly speaking, however, an
element comprises the opening
tag and the closing tag and any
content that lies between them

Attributes Tell Us
More About Elements

Attributes provide additional information
about the contents of an element. They appear
on the opening tag of the element and are
made up of two parts: a name and a value,
separated by an equals sign.

<p lang="en-us">Paragraph in English</p>

The attribute name indicates
what kind of extra information
you are supplying about the
element's content. It should be
written in lowercase.

The value is the information
or setting for the attribute. It
should be placed in double
quotes. Different attributes can
have different values.

Here an attribute called lang is
used to indicate the language
used in this element. The value
of this attribute on this page
specifies it is in US English.

Body, Head & Title

<body>
You met the <body> element
in the first example we created.
Everything inside this element is
shown inside the main browser
window.


<head>
Before the <body> element you
will often see a <head> element.
This contains information
about the page (rather than
information that is shown within
the main part of the browser
window that is highlighted in
blue on the opposite page).
You will usually find a <title>
element inside the <head>
element.


<title>
The contents of the <title>
element are either shown in the
top of the browser, above where
you usually type in the URL of
the page you want to visit, or
on the tab for that page (if your
browser uses tabs to allow you
to view multiple pages at the
same time).

- HTML pages are text documents.
- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as elements.
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
- Attributes require a name and a value.
- To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.
